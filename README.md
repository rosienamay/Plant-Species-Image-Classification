# Plant-Species-Image-Classification

A. Project Overview:

This project is a classification of tropical plants specifically focuses on building dataset of different varieties of Philippine Orchids. The primary goal of this project is to collect and classify images about various orchid species to create a structured dataset that can be used for plant identification in machine learning applications. The classification includes multiple orchid varieties captured from different angles to ensure accuracy. 

#Purpose:

The purpose of this image classification model is to automatically identify and categorize different varieties of tropical orchids plants. By training the model, the system recognizes patterns such as the shape, color, and structure to accurately classify each orchid species. This will help reduce manual identification errors and provide a reliable source for future data analysis or AI-based plant recognition system.

<b>Common Name:</b>  Boat Orchid or Noble Orchid<br>
<b>Scientific Name:</b> <i>Cymbidium (Genus)</i> <br><br>
<b>Description:</b> Cymbidium orchids are a genus of approximately 55–80 species of evergreen, perennial, and epiphytic (tree-dwelling), lithophytic (rock-growing), or terrestrial (ground-growing) herbs. They are highly popular in horticulture, valued for their long, leathery, strap-like leaves and tall, dramatic, and enduring flower spikes.

<b>Common Name: </b>Dancing Lady Orchid/Dancing Doll Orchid/Golden Shower Orchid<br>
<b>Scientific Name: </b> <i>Oncidium genus</i> <br><br>
<b>Description:</b>Oncidium orchids are primarily epiphytic (growing on trees) and are native to the tropical and subtropical Americas. They are characterized by large, arching sprays or spikes filled with dozens of small, dainty, and often fragrant flowers.

<b>Common Name:</b> Dendrobium Orchid/Stalk Orchids<br><br>
<b>Scientific Name: </b> <i> Dendrobium </i> <br><br>
<b>Description: </b>Dendrobium is a large genus of about 1600 tropical and subtropical herbaceous perennials in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). They are native across a wide area from India, China and Japan to Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. The genus name comes from the Greek words dendron, meaning a tree, and bios, meaning life.

<b>Scientific Name:</b> <i>Odontoglossum</i> <br><br>
<b>Description:</b>Odontoglossum, genus of some 150 species of orchids (family Orchidaceae) that are primarily native to mountainous areas of tropical America. Many Odontoglossum species and hybrids are cultivated for their showy long-lasting flowers and are considered fairly easy to grow. In addition, a number of orchids of other genera have been crossed with species of Odontoglossum to obtain novel hybrid flowers.

<b>Common Name: </b>Red orchids, Designer orchids<br>
<b>Scientific Name: </b> <i>Oncostelopsis</i> <br><br>
<b>Description:</b> Oncostelopsis orchids are mid-sized, compact hybrid plants designed for vibrant color and high flower counts. They are often called "red orchids" or "designer orchids" because they combine the striking, often deep red or magenta, velvety colors and large lips of Miltoniopsis and Rhynchostele with the floriferous, spray-forming habit of Oncidium.

<b>Description:</b>  Phalaenopsis is a genus of roughly 70 species of tropical epiphytic (or sometimes lithophytic) orchids known for their long-lasting, flat, and often fragrant flowers, which are arranged on tall, arching stems. Native to Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia, they feature short stems, broad leathery leaves, and thick roots. Due to their ease of care and ability to bloom in low-light indoor environments for months at a time, they are among the most popular houseplants.
