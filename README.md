# Plant-Species-Image-Classification

A. Project Overview:

This project is a classification of tropical plants specifically focuses on building dataset of different varieties of Philippine Orchids. The primary goal of this project is to collect and classify images about various orchid species to create a structured dataset that can be used for plant identification in machine learning applications. The classification includes multiple orchid varieties captured from different angles to ensure accuracy. 

#Purpose:

The purpose of this image classification model is to automatically identify and categorize different varieties of tropical orchids plants. By training the model, the system recognizes patterns such as the shape, color, and structure to accurately classify each orchid species. This will help reduce manual identification errors and provide a reliable source for future data analysis or AI-based plant recognition system.
